#### Printing:
- I can only recommend you to try to print provided files on a SLA/MSLA printer.  
- Markings on buttons have a width of 0.45mm (0.8mm for PS button), this can be a problem with some resin as some crystals can form into theses marking because of the narrow dimensions (I got hard time printing theses using eSun Hard Tough (ABS Like) resin).  
  
#### "Painting":
On my buttons, I didn't really used paint but Epoxy colored with pigments (2 hours pot life). Using a thru hole resistor pin and a magnifying glass to fill each markings.
