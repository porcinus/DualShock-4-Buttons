# DualShock 4 Buttons
Personal CAD files for DualShock 4 buttons  
  
#### Important note:
- Files provided here are provided "as is".
- Naming :
   - *-org.ext : based on aftermaket buttons.
   - *-mod.ext : modified version that allow custom making based in part on Xbox controller, Share/option button increased height by 1mm for easier use as retro controller (start/select).
   - Don't ask for modification on 'ps-org.XXX' as PlayStation logo is a trademark of Sony.

#### Printing:
- I can only recommend you to try to print provided files on a SLA/MSLA printer.  
- Markings on buttons have a width of 0.45mm (0.8mm for PS button), this can be a problem with some resin as some crystals can form into theses marking because of the narrow dimensions (I got hard time printing theses using eSun Hard Tough (ABS Like) resin).  
  
#### "Painting":
On my buttons, I didn't really used paint but Epoxy colored with pigments to fill each markings.
I am really sorry because I can't really make a video as I lack proper equipment to do so, but I will try to explainations:
- I used 2 hours life Epoxy with various colored pigments and a thru hole resistor.
- Fairly mix enough Epoxy to fill makings (you should prefer to do multiple mix as the more quantity you will do the faster it will cure).
- Use additional containers then mix with proper pigments (fairly mix as well), a drop of white as "back" color plus a drop of proper color, avoid too much pigments per mix a this will increase or even fail you epoxy.
- Dip the end of the pin into epoxy to make a bubble then this bubble on a end of the groove.
- Allow it some time to drop to the bottom and repeat the process until the whole groove is filled.
- Here you want to groove to be a bit "overloaded" a tiny bit.
- Let Epoxy cure for about 24 hours (even with 2 hours pot life epoxy as the lower quantity there is the slower it will take to cure).
- Use P800 or P1000 sandpaper to smooth button top.
- If you printed it with resin: using a brush, add a bit of resin to smooth top of buttons then cure (once again) with UV machine.
- If FDM: you should use acrylic varnish, same process as above without UV machine.
